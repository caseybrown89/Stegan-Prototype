== USAGE ==
Requires Java 1.6 or higher
All audio files should be in WAVE format

Commands:
    ./stegan --encode file1 file2 file3
    ./stegan --decode file4 file5

where

    file1 is the name of an existing WAVE file that
    contains an audio recording (the "carrier").

    file2 is the name of an existing file (of arbitrary type)
    that contains the binary message to be added to file1.

    file3 is the name of the WAVE file to be created
    by adding the binary message in file2 to the recording
    in file1.

    file4 is the name of an existing WAVE file that
    may have been created by your software (as the file3 in
    the --encode direction).

    file5 is the name of a file to be created by extracting
    a binary message from file4 (under the assumption that
    file4 was created by your software as the file3 in the
    --encode direction).
